# null-gui
**null-gui** - is a graphical interface, originally developed as a semi-paste of imgui, but after a while I was no longer satisfied with the code base of the old project, and I decided to rewrite everything from scratch (but in the end I still pasted some parts of the code from other projects). Due to the fact that the first version of the project was imgui paste, for the most part the functional style was used, which inevitably led to shitty code, because. this style is not suitable for large graphical interfaces (well, or I just could not implement everything without shit code, which is more likely), the new version is written in the oop style.
